Fixed following errors:
1. Driver init was at wrong place- Fixed by initializing it after setting driver path. 
2. Updated Selenium client and Chrome driver (to latest version) to avoid compatibility issue.
3. Fixed SignInTest by switching to frame(signInWindow) before clicking on signInButton.
4. Fixed FlightBookingTest by changing locator for destination city. (id attribute was not giving proper result)
5. Fixed HotelBookingTest using pageFactory initElements (Init was missing)

Enhancement done:
1. Added missing assertion for HotelSearchTest (without checkIn date)
2. Used page object design pattern for all tests.
3. Moved Driver init and quit methods to parent class to that all tests can inherit them.
4. Created BasePage to have common methods to be used by all child pages.
5. Created SearchResultPage for assertion of successful flight or hotel search. 
6. Moved test data to test classes to support parameterization 
7. Removed hard coded wait and improved using implicit/explicit/AjaxElementLocatorFactory
8. Added testng.xml with Support for parallel test

1. Include Browser factory and support for other browsers (e.g.firefox)
2. Capture screenshots whenever needed.
